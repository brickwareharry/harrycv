This holds Harry's CV on the GitHub page of this repository.
# Work Done:
I am looking for a simple and quick way to display a document on a GitHub page. Here Microsoft Word was used for creating the web page of a CV. 
# Problem:
However, the GitHub page cannot display the special characters and formats of the Word file, see https://brickwareharry.github.io/harrycv/
# TODO:
