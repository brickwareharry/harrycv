# harrycv repository
This holds Harry's CV on the GitHub page of this repository. However the GitHub page cannot properly show the special characters and complex formats which converted from Microsoft docmument file to HTML file. Futher explanation and actions are given in the following sections.
# Work Done:
I am looking for a simple and quick way to display a document on a GitHub page. Here Microsoft Word was used for creating the web page of a CV. 
# Problem:
However, the GitHub page cannot display the special characters and formats of the Word file, see https://brickwareharry.github.io/harrycv/
# TODO:
I will look for other simple and quick way to display a document on a GitHub page. It may be Markdown, Jekyll, MkDocs, Docusaurus or Pandoc.
1. Pandoc.
    - Pandoc can convert Micorsoft Word file (*.docx) into Markdown file (*.md)
    - Details of Pandoc can be found at https://pandoc.org/; Quick reference could be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPSK7q13-40
    - Markdown file can be displayed on GitHub page.
    - I am going to use Pandoc to comvert my CV in docx format into either Markdown or html in order to display it on the GitHub page
2. Will see: Markdown, Jekyll, MkDocs, Docusaurus
